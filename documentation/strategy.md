# Roles

## Lumberjack Role

* Find trees
* Locate base and note highest log block
* Create a two-block vertical space where Y is sufficient to reach the top log
	and a staircase to stand in that space if needed.
* Break logs bottom up
* Remove staircase
* Remove stump
* Store logs and replace tools as needed.
* Always pick up nearby drops.

## Miner role

Staircase Dig to Y = 11 from back of hollow-out preferably towards +X / East.

Irrigate-Mine +/- 50 blocks out with singles on Z and double-wide centre on X.
Y = 11 should always have pathways on center and channels after acquiring
interfering valuables.

	Craft Armor
	Craft Bucket
	Improve tools

Acquire Gold

Acquire Redstone

Acquire Lapis Lazuli

food is needed to fight. Come back to this after getting a full stack of bread
and preferably a set of at least iron armor.

## Farmer role

* Flatten surface for farming
* Create a dirt box near hollow-out entry
* Acquire Wheat Seeds
* Plant near water, replace non-dirt with dirt adjacent to water and up to watering distance
* Sleep at night, expand until ~150 wheat blocks are concurrently planted.
* If you have a bucket, create the farm beside the shelter entrance.

* Boats need canals and water tunnels
	* Connect nearby waterways
	* Get to tidewater
