# Lumberjack Bugs
* Wait after breaking last block on a tree for the drop to hit the ground and stop moving before starting to collect ungrabbed blocks
* Tree portions that are too high result in the bot swinging uselessly at an out-of-reach block (but bot moves on gracefully)
* Tool management doesn't work properly
	* A just-crafted axe is not equiped, probably a timing issue
* Inventory management is not implemented.
* Spruce trees do not always conform to the tree criteria
