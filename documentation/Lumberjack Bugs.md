# Lumberjack Bugs
* Tree portions that are too high result in the bot swinging uselessly at an out-of-reach block (but bot moves on gracefully)
* Bot path-finds through glass, cobblestone, and crops - vandalization. A whole lot of block types should be avoided by the pathfinder
* Closed doors are non navigable?
* Pathfinder can change what is equipped - equip after arriving at goals
* Pathfinder can stall out
* Dumb paths sometimes, not determined by travel time where breaking time is calculated
* Pathfinder sometimes drowns
