# Irrigation Miner Bot Notes

## Prepare for Descent

A steady supply of torches are needed

* Find and get surface coal
* Make charcoal

## Descent

Calculate a staircase dig pattern to Y = 5 that does not intersect with water or lava.

Line stairwell with cobblestone stairs

# Prepare Lower Base

At the bottom, 2 wide center tunnel with 1 wide side tunnels out for 100 blocks. Irrigation style.

Keep two furnaces (or blast furnaces). One for iron and one for gold.
Keep a crafting table
Keep two large chests - one to offload junk (Cobblestone, dirt, gravel, flint) and one to offload everything else.

## Exploratory Mining

Tunnel forward and check for something interesting every time

When something interesting is found (coal, iron, gold, diamond, lapis lazuli, red stone, lava, water, air), switch behaviours.
	* Mine Valuables
	* Dry out water or lava
	* Note cave for later exploration and abandon irrigation arm.

When all picks (or all of one tool type) are broken or inventory is full, stash, smelt, and recraft tools

Always keep everything well lit. Center gets two torches between every arm. Arms get torches every 7 or 8 blocks.

## Haul out

When either chest at Y = 5 are full, Compress.
If still full, haul out stuff to surface warehouse.
