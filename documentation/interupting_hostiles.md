# Interrupting Hostile Mobs

When the bot is attacked

* What it's currently busy with should be dehydrated and current task queues purged
* Sword should be equipped
* All hostiles in a 16 block radius should be systematically fought off.
* The current task queue should be restored, or the task type started anew.

# Mob-Specific Behaviours

* Creeper - Run close, hit, then move back to a distance just inside the edge of where it will trigger its explosion.
* Skeleton - Get 1 away and hit repeatedly
* Zombie - Stay stationary and hit when it's one away
* Other - Use skeleton strategy until I make a better one.
