# Autobot

Autobot is intended to be a minecraft player simulator. It currently is fairly rudimentary and is functionally an infinite autonomous lumberjack that will self-equip with a wooden axe.

Autobot currently only implements the following behaviours:

* Autonomous crafting including locating or crafting a crafting table
* Locating and cutting down trees
* Collecting nearby drops on the ground

The Intended development roadmap (in chronological order) is:

* Crafting and placing chests to store collected resources
* label chests (with signs probably)
* Bootstrapping type activities

## Running

* Server:
	* PaperMC - Tested using build 185 (Client/Server 1.16.2)
	* Set online mode to false
